Starting in January 2025, I will join the University of Houston as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/people/faculty/jiaxuan-li/). I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in geophysics at [Caltech Seismolab](https://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/) working with [Prof. Zhongwen Zhan](https://zhan.caltech.edu/). Previously, I received my Ph.D. in geophysics at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/) advised by [Prof. Yingcai Zheng](https://uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/people/faculty/yingcai-zheng/) in 2020, and my B.S. degree at [Peking Univesity](https://sess2.pku.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2015. 

My current research uses fiber-optic technologies to study seismic activities and image subsurface structures in diverse environments, including crustal, volcanic, and glacial settings. My recent study in Iceland demonstrates the use of low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing as a dense geodetic array to achieve minute-scale imaging of magma migration within magmatic plumbing systems. This research paves the way for the emerging fiber-optic geodesy, showing great potential for future research and applications. I am also interested in carbon sequestration, geothermal energy, and deep earthquakes.
