	title = {Minute-scale dynamics of recurrent dike intrusions in Iceland with fiber-optic geodesy},
	abstract = {Continuous geodetic measurements near volcanic systems have revealed dynamic magmatic transport, yet capturing high spatio-temporal resolution dike intrusion dynamics remains challenging. We use low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (LFDAS) recordings along a telecommunication fiber cable to track dike intrusions near Grindavík, Iceland. LFDAS recordings show distinct strain responses from nine intrusive events, six resulting in fissure eruptions. We image complex magma intrusions propagating on the minute time scale, forming observed lava fissures in eruptive events or remaining trapped at depth in arrested intrusions. Our results highlight the feasibility of using DAS for a dense array of strainmeters, enabling high-resolution, nearly real-time imaging of subsurface quasi-static deformations. In active volcanic regions, LFDAS recordings can offer critical insights into magmatic evolution, eruption forecasting, and volcanic hazard assessment.},

        abstract = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is an emerging technology that converts optical fibers into dense arrays of strainmeters, significantly enhancing our understanding of earthquake physics and Earth's structure. While most past DAS studies have focused primarily on seismic wave phase information, accurate measurements of true ground motion amplitudes are crucial for comprehensive future analyses. However, amplitudes in DAS recordings, especially for pre-existing telecommunication cables with uncertain fiber-ground coupling, have not been fully quantified. By calibrating three DAS arrays with co-located seismometers, we systematically evaluate DAS amplitudes. Our results indicate that the average DAS amplitude of earthquake signals closely matches that of co-located seismometer data across frequencies from 0.01 to 10 Hz. The noise floor of DAS is comparable to that of strong-motion stations but higher than that of broadband stations. The saturation amplitude of DAS is adjustable by modifying the pulse repetition rate and gauge length. We also demonstrate how our findings enhance the understanding of fiber-optic seismology and its implications for natural hazard mitigation and Earth structure imaging and monitoring. Specifically, our results suggest that with proper settings, DAS can detect P-waves from an M6+ earthquake occurring 10 km from the cable without saturation, indicating its viability for earthquake early warning. Through quantitative comparison and analysis, we also find that local ambient traffic noise levels strongly affect the quality of seismic interferometry measurement, which is a powerful tool for near-surface imaging and monitoring. Our methodology and findings are valuable for future DAS experiments that require precise seismic amplitude measurements.},

This effect results in the opening and closing of microcracks in the vicinity of the intrusion, which can affect regional seismic velocities. In late November 2023, we deployed a distributed acoustic sensing interrogator to convert an existing 100-km telecommunication fiber-optic cable along the coast of Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula into a dense seismic array, which has run continuously. Measuring changes in surface wave moveout with ambient noise cross-correlation, we observe up to 2\% changes in Rayleigh wave phase velocity (dv/v) {\textbackslash}(dv/v){\textbackslash} following eruptions in the peninsula's 2023–2024 sequence that are likely associated with magmatic intrusions into the eruption-feeding dike. We apply a Bayesian inversion to compute the posterior distribution of potential dike opening models for each eruption by considering dv/v {\textbackslash}dv/v{\textbackslash} measurements for varying channel pairs and frequency bands, and assuming this velocity change is tied to volumetric strain associated with dike-opening. Our results are in agreement with those based on geodetic measurement and provide independent constraints on the depth of the dike, demonstrating the viability of this novel inversion and new volcano monitoring directions through fiber sensing.},

We analyzed 7,093 high-quality SWS measurements from teleseismic S waves recorded by Hi-net stations across the Ryukyu arc in Japan. Our findings show a systematic rotation of the fast S polarization from trench-parallel to trench-perpendicular depending on the earthquake backazimuth. For the same earthquake, the measured splitting patterns also vary spatially across the southwest Japan. Using full-wave seismic modeling, we showed that a dipping slab with ∼30\% shear anisotropy of the tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) type, with a symmetry axis perpendicular to the slab interface, can predict the observed delay times and polarization rotation. Our results highlight the importance of considering dipping anisotropic slabs in interpreting SWS at subduction zones.},

CASSM acquisition was conducted using 24 hydrophones, 18 accelerometers, and 17 piezoelectric sources within four fracture-parallel wells and two orthogonal wells. 3D anisotropic traveltime tomography and anisotropic elastic-waveform inversion of the campaign cross-borehole seismic data show that the rock within the stimulation region is a heterogeneous horizontal transverse isotropic medium.

Building on a well-constrained microseismic event catalog, we invert for moment tensor of the events to better understand the fracture geometry and stress orientations. However, it is challenging because of the unknown orientation of 3C accelerometers and low signal-to-noise-ratio nature of high-frequency (several kHz) monitoring. To address these challenges, we first perform the hodogram analysis on the continuous active-source seismic monitoring (CASSM) data to determine the orientations of the 18 3C accelerometers. We then apply the principal component analysis (PCA) to the observed microseismic waveforms to improve the signal-to-noise ratios. We perform a grid search for the full moment tensor by fitting the PCA-denoised waveforms at a frequency range of 5 to 8 kHz. The moment tensor results show both the creation of hydraulic fractures and the reactivation of natural fractures during the hydraulic stimulations. Our stress inversion based on the inverted moment tensors reveals the alteration of stress regime caused by hydraulic fracture stimulations.},

We propose a velocity correction method based on adjusting the apparent channel spacing according to water depth to overcome the challenge of detecting long-wavelength and long-period tsunami signals. Experimental results demonstrate the successful retrieval of infragravity and tsunami waves using a subsea optical fiber in offshore Oregon. These findings underscore the potential of DAS technology to complement existing infragravity waves detection systems, enhance preparedness, and improve response efforts in coastal communities. Further research and development in this field are crucial to fully utilize the capabilities of DAS for enhanced tsunami monitoring and warning systems.},

By converting a 100-kilometre dark-fibre cable into a 10,000-channel seismic array, we image four high-frequency subevents for the 2021 Antelope Valley, California, moment-magnitude 6.0 earthquake. After comparing our results with long-period moment-release10,11 and dynamic rupture simulations, we suggest that the imaged subevents are due to the breaking of fault asperities—stronger spots or pins on the fault—that substantially modulate the overall rupture behaviour. An otherwise fading rupture propagation could be promoted by the breaking of fault asperities in a cascading sequence. This study highlights how we can use the extensive pre-existing fibre networks12 as high-frequency seismic antennas to systematically investigate the rupture process of regional moderate-sized earthquakes.

	abstract = {Earthquake focal mechanisms provide critical in-situ insights about the subsurface faulting geometry and stress state. For frequent small earthquakes (magnitude{\textless} 3.5), their focal mechanisms are routinely determined using first-arrival polarities picked on the vertical component of seismometers. Nevertheless, their quality is usually limited by the azimuthal coverage of the local seismic network. The emerging distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology, which can convert pre-existing telecommunication cables into arrays of strain/strain-rate meters, can potentially fill the azimuthal gap and enhance constraints on the nodal plane orientation through its long sensing range and dense spatial sampling. However, determining first-arrival polarities on DAS is challenging due to its single-component sensing and low signal-to-noise ratio for direct body waves. Here, we present a data-driven method that measures P-wave polarities on a DAS array based on cross-correlations between earthquake pairs. We validate the inferred polarities using the regional network catalog on two DAS arrays, deployed in California and each comprising {\textasciitilde} 5000 channels. We demonstrate that a joint focal mechanism inversion combining conventional and DAS polarity picks improves the accuracy and reduces the uncertainty in the focal plane orientation.

	abstract = {Characterizing fracture zones is crucial in geothermal exploration, drilling, and development. We aim to characterize small-scale fractures with scales less than the seismic wavelength. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been popular in interpreting large-scale faults by finding offsets in seismic images. However, such offsets may not be associated with small-scale fractures. By shooting a seismic beam from the Earth’s surface to subsurface fracture zones, we can extract a receiver-beam interference pattern created by fracturegenerated multiple-scattering waves in observed seismic data. The double-beam interference pattern is a two-dimensional image that carries information about the discrete fracture network pattern. Under the ideal situation (e.g., perfect data acquisition and homogeneous medium), the beam inference pattern and the discrete fracture pattern are Fourier transform pairs. However, in real-world cases, such a Fourier transform relation is perturbed. We need to train the machine learning algorithm to be able to handle such a physical constraint. To demonstrate the capability of the method for small-scale fracture characterization, we construct a subsurface model containing smallscale fractures based on the Soda Lake geothermal field. We perform seismic modeling to generate 3D seismic data and apply our method to the data to characterize the discrete fractures, which are almost invisible on conventional seismic migration images.},

	abstract = {The moment tensors of a large portion of deep earthquakes show apparent non-double-couple (non-DC) components. Previously, the observed apparent non-DC values in deep earthquakes have been attributed to different mechanisms such as complex source processes or complicated source medium structures. In this paper, we focused on evaluating the second mechanism. We investigated the effect of slab heterogeneity, supra-slab anisotropic structure, intra-slab weakly anisotropic structure (e.g., the purported existence of the metastable olivine wedge), and non-uniform station coverage, on the non-DC radiation patterns of deep earthquakes using our 3-dimensional elastic finite-difference modeling and full-waveform inversion of moment tensors. We found that these investigated issues cannot cause the observed non-double-couple radiation patterns and the in-situ structure with strong S-wave anisotropy near to the earthquake focus is the simplest way to account for the apparent non-DC components in the radiation patterns of deep earthquakes.},

However, it is unknown if one can find a stochastic binary field to generate the observed spectrum. We propose a novel and powerful constructive procedure for this purpose. The procedure allows us not only to test whether certain binary mixing is feasible but also to tightly constrain the properties of the mixing components and the modal proportion. The method should find wide applications in many branches of geosciences.},

	abstract = {In December 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission deployed a seismometer on the surface of Mars. In preparation for the data analysis, in July 2017, the marsquake service initiated a blind test in which participants were asked to detect and characterize seismicity embedded in a one Earth year long synthetic data set of continuous waveforms. Synthetic data were computed for a single station, mimicking the streams that will be available from InSight as well as the expected tectonic and impact seismicity, and noise conditions on Mars (Clinton et al., 2017). In total, 84 teams from 20 countries registered for the blind test and 11 of them submitted their results in early 2018. The collection of documentations, methods, ideas, and codes submitted by the participants exceeds 100 pages. The teams proposed well established as well as novel methods to tackle the challenging target of building a global seismicity catalog using a single station. This article summarizes the performance of the teams and highlights the most successful contributions.},

	abstract = {Production allocation refers to the practice of quantifying proportions of extracted commingled hydrocarbons across various contributing sources. In this paper we tested a new geochemical technique of trace element production allocation by analyzing the mass fractions of specific target elements in five end-member natural crude oils and the manually mixed crude oil in precisely controlled proportions. We analyzed target elements by ICP-OES and Triple Quadrupole (QQQ)-ICP-MS techniques in tandem on each sample. In our test, the contributing fractions of the five end-member oils were measured by weight and mixed in proportions of ∼30\%, 25\%, 20\%, 15\%, and 10\% in the commingled oil. The obtained mass fractions for specific target elements in both the five end-member oils and the commingled oil are input into a program developed called “ALLO-TRACE”. ALLO-TRACE calculates the contributing fractions of all the end-member oils to the commingled oil using multiple analyte-based linear equations. Our repeated tests have shown that the calculated contribution fractions based on the mass fractions of multiple trace elements agree well with their known contribution fractions in the commingled oil. Accuracies of most calculations for all the five end-member oil target proportions are within 4\%, and the best can be less than 0.6\% for all end members (average 0.17\% and median 0.1\%). Most calculation uncertainties in terms of relative standard deviations of the five end-member oils are within 3\%, and the best can be less than 2.3\% for all end members (average 1.2\% and median 0.9\%).},

	abstract = {Analysis of deep subduction-zone earthquakes, those at depths greater than 60 km, reveals the physical and chemical properties of a descending oceanic lithosphere at mantle depths. Over the past five decades, it has been observed that a large fraction of deep earthquakes has non-double-couple (non-DC) seismic radiation patterns. In contrast, shallow earthquakes tend to have DC radiation patterns due to mechanisms of shear faulting. These observations have been used to argue that deep earthquakes rupture differently from shallow earthquakes. Here we show that the observed global distribution of non-DC deep earthquakes could be caused by shear faulting mechanisms, but in a highly anisotropic laminated rock fabric that surrounds the deep earthquakes within subducted slabs. For intermediate-depth earthquakes ({\textasciitilde}60–300 km), we found a large shear-wave anisotropy of {\textasciitilde}25\%, possibly caused by laminated fabric or aligned melt pockets oriented parallel to the slab interface, which provides new supporting evidence for the metamorphic dehydration reactions in slabs. However, at deep-focus depths ({\textgreater}300 km), the putative metastable phase-change mechanism alone cannot explain the seismic anisotropy. Instead, our results and those from recent experiments suggest materials such as magnesite, or perhaps carbonatite melt, may play a role in generating deep-focus earthquakes.},
